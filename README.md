1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd agentic-ai-prototype
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎯 Demo Instructions

### Sample Scenarios

The system includes 4 realistic Ghanaian fintech scenarios:

1. **Makola Market Transaction Fee Survey** (Successful)
   - Tests pricing sensitivity among informal traders
   - Triggers value proposition and revenue stream updates

2. **Rural USSD Interface Usability Testing** (Failed)
   - Reveals UX complexity issues in rural areas
   - Suggests channel and customer relationship improvements

3. **Kumasi Region Agent Network Pilot** (Inconclusive)
   - Mixed results from agent network deployment
   - Requires partnership and cost structure evaluation

4. **ARB Apex Bank Partnership Agreement** (Successful)
   - Successful rural bank partnership
   - Expands market reach and partnership strategies

### How to Use

1. **Select Input Method**
   - Choose "Select Sample Action" for pre-configured scenarios
   - Choose "Custom Action Input" for your own data

2. **Analyze Action Outcome**
   - Click "🚀 Analyze Action Outcome" to start the AI workflow
   - Watch the 4-agent processing pipeline in action

3. **Review Results**
   - Examine proposed changes with confidence scores
   - Review reasoning and next action recommendations
   - Compare before/after business model states

4. **Apply Changes**
   - **Auto-mode**: Automatically applies safe changes (>70% confidence)
   - **Manual mode**: Review and selectively apply changes
   - View change history and audit trail

## 🧠 System Intelligence

### Business Model Canvas Integration

The system understands all 9 BMC sections:
- Customer Segments
- Value Propositions
- Channels
- Customer Relationships
- Revenue Streams
- Key Resources
- Key Activities
- Key Partnerships
- Cost Structure

### African Market Context

- **Informal Economy Focus**: 86% of Ghana's economy
- **Mobile-First Approach**: USSD accessibility on basic phones
- **Local Language Support**: Twi, Hausa, Ewe, Ga
- **Cultural Considerations**: Trust-building, community networks
