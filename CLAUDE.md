- Pydantic for data validation and type safety
- Streamlit for rapid UI prototyping
- Python 3.9+ with modern async patterns where beneficial

### Business Context
- Target market: African entrepreneurs, specifically Ghana-based fintech startup scenario
- Focus on informal economy, mobile payments, low-resource environments

### 3. mock_data.py

Create realistic sample data representing a Ghanaian fintech startup:

**Sample BusinessModelCanvas:**
- Customer segments: informal traders, rural farmers, unbanked youth
- Value propositions: USSD mobile payments, low fees, local agents
- Channels: agent networks, USSD, word-of-mouth
- Revenue streams: transaction fees, agent commissions
- Key partnerships: rural banks, mobile operators (MTN, Vodafone Ghana)
- Cost structure: technology, agent network, compliance
- Make all entries specific to Ghana/West Africa context

**Sample CompletedActions (create 3-4 scenarios):**

Scenario 1 - Pricing Survey:
- Action: Survey 50 Makola Market traders about transaction fee tolerance
- Outcome: SUCCESSFUL
- Results: 60% accept current 2% fee, 30% want lower, 10% willing to pay more for speed
- Should trigger value proposition and revenue stream updates

Scenario 2 - USSD Interface Test:
- Action: Test USSD menu with 100 rural users
- Outcome: FAILED
- Results: 45% couldn't complete transactions, menu too complex
- Should trigger channel and customer relationship updates

Scenario 3 - Agent Network Pilot:
- Action: Deploy 20 agents in Kumasi region
- Outcome: INCONCLUSIVE
- Results: High transaction volume but agent complaints about low commissions
- Should trigger key partnerships and cost structure evaluation

### 4. agentic_engine.py

This is the core file. Implement a sophisticated 4-agent workflow using LangChain:

**AgenticOrchestrator Class:**

**Agent 1: ActionDetectionAgent**
- Purpose: Parse and validate completed action data
- Input: Raw action outcome information
- Process: Validate data structure, extract key metrics, classify outcome type
- Output: Structured CompletedAction object
- LangChain Tools: Use Pydantic parsing, data validation chains
- Prompt Engineering: Focus on data extraction and classification

**Agent 2: OutcomeAnalysisAgent**
- Purpose: Analyze business implications of action outcomes
- Input: Validated action + current business model context
- Process: Deep reasoning about what the results mean strategically
- Output: Business impact assessment with specific insights
- LangChain Tools: Use OpenAI GPT-4 with business analysis prompt templates
- Prompt Engineering: Include African market context, informal economy understanding

**Agent 3: CanvasUpdateAgent**
- Purpose: Generate specific business model canvas updates
- Input: Analysis insights + current BMC/VPC state
- Process: Determine which canvas sections need updates and how
- Output: List of ProposedChange objects with detailed reasoning
- LangChain Tools: Structured output chains, business framework knowledge
- Prompt Engineering: Understand BMC relationships and dependencies

**Agent 4: NextStepAgent**
- Purpose: Suggest intelligent follow-up actions
- Input: Updated canvas state + historical context
- Process: Strategic thinking about what experiments to run next
- Output: Prioritized list of recommended next actions
- LangChain Tools: Strategic planning chains, pattern recognition
- Prompt Engineering: Focus on validation methodology and startup best practices

**Workflow Coordination:**
- Implement sequential agent execution with data passing
- Add error handling and fallback logic
- Include memory persistence between agent calls
- Use LangChain's AgentExecutor patterns properly
- Implement async patterns for better performance

**Integration Methods:**
- process_action_outcome(action_data) -> AgentRecommendation
- get_business_context() -> current BMC/VPC state
- apply_changes(proposed_changes) -> updated business model
- validate_safety(proposed_changes) -> safety check for auto-mode

### 5. utils.py

Create utility functions:

**Data Management:**
- load_business_model() -> loads current BMC state
- save_business_model(bmc) -> persists updates
- create_change_history(old_state, new_state, trigger_action) -> version tracking
- validate_change_safety(change) -> determines if safe for auto-application

**UI Helpers:**
- format_proposed_changes(changes) -> human-readable display
- create_before_after_comparison(old_bmc, new_bmc) -> side-by-side view
- generate_change_summary(applied_changes) -> notification text

**Business Logic:**
- calculate_confidence_score(reasoning, historical_data) -> confidence rating
- determine_change_impact(change, bmc) -> assess change significance
- suggest_validation_experiments(updated_bmc) -> next action ideas

### 6. app.py
